				Samoyeds are descended from the Nenets herding laika, a spitz-type dog from Siberia used for sledding,
				herding, guarding, and keeping their owners warm.Fridtjof Nansen believed that the use of sled dogs was
				the only effective way to explore the north and used Samoyeds on his polar expeditions. His plan to feed
				the weaker dogs to the stronger ones as the former died during the expedition ultimately consumed nearly
				all of his dogs.The Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern
				breeds in the 19th Century.
